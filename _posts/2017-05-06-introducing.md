THE CANADIAN PREMIER LEAGUE IS HERE!!! LONG LIVE THE CANADIAN PREMIER LEAGUE!!!
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Earlier today the Canadian Premier League received unanimous support to join Canada Soccer, ending years of speculation and rumours. In addition, Hamilton and Winnipeg ownership groups also received unanimous support to join.

When the rumours first started about Canada possibly having it’s own professional league I promised myself that I would start a blog to help promote it. So, here I am, introducing _Bend it Like Bekker._ I’m still not sure what the focus of the blog will be, I only know it will be about the Canadian Premier League and Canadian Soccer.

So what do we know about the Canadian Premier League so far? Well we know it has one employee in [Paul Beirne](https://twitter.com/Paulbeirne) and that it will have at least 2 teams, Winnipeg and Hamilton. It [looks](https://twitter.com/CanadaSoccerEN/status/860922063757819904) like the Hamilton team will be owned by Bob Young as expected and that the Winnipeg team will be owned by the Blue Bombers through something called the [Winnipeg Football Club](https://juneof86.com/2017/05/06/dare-to-dream-canadian-premier-league-approved-by-csa/). Other than that, only speculation. Kevin Senior has an excellent round-up at [Northern Starting XI](http://www.northernstartingeleven.com/category/canpl/), that I suggest you check out, which has all the rumours.

I don’t know when the next post will be but I guess it depends on any more news.

In the meantime, what do you think the teams will be named? It has to be the Hamilton Steelers, right? But will it be the Winnipeg Fury which would clash with the Ottawa Fury? I mean that would be CFL thing to do.
