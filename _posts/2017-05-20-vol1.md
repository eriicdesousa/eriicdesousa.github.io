Here are some things I’m wondering about the Canadian Premier League

![](/assets/bekker/1WdVO5mhVs82v8SE5gGjZYg.jpeg)

**How many teams will the league have at the start?**

It looks like the league will have between 6–10 teams and I think that is a nice number to start, but what I really hope is that it is an even number so that every team plays every weekend.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**So where will the teams will be located?**

We know for sure that there will be teams in Hamilton and Winnipeg and we know that there will be a team in Halifax if the Regional Council approves the building of a temporary stadium on Wanderers Grounds. I’m guessing the other possible 7 teams might be Kitchener-Waterloo, Regina or Saskatoon, Quebec City, Calgary, Edmonton, Ottawa and Victoria.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**When will the league start?**

It will either start in August 2018 to try to ride the momentum of the World Cup or in the Spring of 2019. I think the league should have a proper start in 2019 but I think that having some friendly games in 2018 like FC Edmonton had in 2010 is the right thing to do.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**What happens with the Ottawa Fury and FC Edmonton?**

I don’t think either will play in the CPL from the start. The Fury just paid a five million dollars expansion fee to join the USL and it is well known that the Faths are investors in the NASL and have no interest in joining the CPL. I think the Fury will join the CPL first after seeing that the league is stable. The Edmonton situation is more complex, I think another ownership group might launch a CPL team in that market instead. The only way I see FC Edmonton joining the CPL is if the NASL and USL merge, giving the Faths a proper exit strategy.

**What will the CPL schedule look like?**

Assuming the league starts in 2019 with six teams, how many times will teams face each other? I’d say say probably 4, giving the league a 20 league schedule. But maybe the league can’t have a balanced schedule in because of travel so I’m not sure how many games there will be. One thing I hope that from the start the league starts respecting FIFA breaks and no games are played during those periods. Another thing I suggest is that there are no games during the group stages of international tournaments like the Gold Cup, Euros and World Cup.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Will the CPL have playoffs to decide the champion?**

I really hope not, as we’ve seen in MLS it’s a terrible way to define a champion since you just need to be playing great at a specific time period instead of trying to be consistently great.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Will the league have bastardized European teams names?**

Please let there not be a Canadian equivalent of Real Salt Lake and Sporting Kansas City. Also I don’t get why teams are called “football clubs” if the game is called soccer in North America.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**What will the Canadian Quota look like?**

Well, to start, we need to stop calling it the Canadian Quota. It’s the CANADIAN Premier League, there is no such thing as a Canadian Quota, what will exist is an International Quota. The leagues in Asia generally only allow four international players per team and one of those four needs to be an Asian player. I believe that may be a bit extreme, I think that between 7 and 9 international players per team is reasonable, that would mean that two thirds of the roster would be Canadian players. I’ll concede that that number may be unrealistic in the first years of the league and the number of international players may be bigger. The definition of who counts as a Canadian player is also important. Currently the rule in the Canadian Championship is _“a player must be a Canadian Citizen and/or hold a Canadian passport and, not played for, or represented, by virtue of dual citizenship or parental lineage, any other Member Association National soccer team, at any level, unless a change of Association, in accordance with FIFA Statutes, to Canada Soccer has been granted” ,_ that rule was implemented because, despite the Canadian Quota for Canadian MLS teams being just three players, the Whitecaps decided to sign Alain Rochat to fill one of those spots. I think that the rule in the CPL should be different and allow any Canadian Citizen and/or hold a Canadian passport holder to be considered Canadian, because since the majority of the teams rosters will be composed by Canadian players there won’t be an abuse of the rule and this allows a guy like Emery Welshman, who was developed in the Canadian system, to be considered domestic.

**How will we be able to watch the games?**

Ideally the league will have a TV deal. The most logic partner would be TSN but a part of me hope that doesn’t happen. It’s 2017 and TSN still doesn’t offer an online only package. I think the league needs to have a strong online presence. Of course, I’m being a bit selfish here, if the games are on TSN there isn’t a legalish way of me watching the games in Portugal, where I live.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Will there be minimum coaching standards?**

All leagues around the world require that head coaches have minimum level of coaching badges and I think the CPL must do the same. Of course there are ways to work around those requirements like TFC did when they hired Ryan Nelsen. When, TFC hired Ryan Nelsen they also hired Fran O’Leary who has the Continental Pro coaching licence, I bet that in all MLS official paperwork Fran O’Leary was the head coach because of the coaching badges.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Will the CPL have a relationship with U Sports (formerly the CIS) and the CCAA?**

I think that is very important that the CPL has a relationship with U Sports and the CCAA, as we’re seeing in MLS right now there is good Canadian talent in those leagues. I don’t think there needs to be a draft but some sort of agreement is important.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Will Sigma change their philosophy?**

From their inception Sigma’s model has been to try to funnel their players to college. Will they be linked directly to a CPL team and change the way they do things?
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**What does the CPL mean for the Canadian Championship?**

First of all I think it is time that the Canadian Championship changes its name. It made sense to be called championship when it was a round robin tournament, that is no longer the case and it is never going back. I suggest it be renamed the Canada’s Voyageurs Cup, and I suggest the CSA officially recognizes the Impacts six wins before it became the Canadian Championship. Those things may not seem to matter right now but they will in 100 years, thrust me.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Will Canada get another spot in the CONCACAF Champions League?**

Since CONCACAF’s president is Canadian and what Canadian teams have produced in the competition I’m expecting Canada will be granted two spots in the competition. One for the Canadian Premier League winner and one for the Canada’s Voyageurs Cup winner (see, the name sounds good). I don’t expect it right away but I think it will happen in 2020. I also expect that the 2 spots won’t qualify for the same stage of the CCL.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Will Atiba Hutchinson be the original face of the CPL?**

I know Atiba Hutchinson has been mentioned as a Whitecaps target but, come on, I love Atiba but that would be a TERRIBLE signing for them, not because of his quality but what sense does it make to sign another defensive midfielder as a DP? Instead let his contract with Besiktas end in June 2018 and have him sign with a CPL team, becoming the original face of the CPL.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Will I get a job in Canada, in a city that has a CPL team, before the league starts?**

Let’s hope so, let’s hope so.
